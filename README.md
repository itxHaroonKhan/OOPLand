# 🚀 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

This project demonstrates the fundamental principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using practical examples.

---

## 📘 What is OOP?

**Object-Oriented Programming** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). OOP helps make code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

## 🧱 Core Principles of OOP

1. **Encapsulation**
   - Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class).
   - Example: Using private variables and public methods to control access.

2. **Abstraction**
   - Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.
   - Example: Abstract classes or interfaces.

3. **Inheritance**
   - One class can inherit the properties and methods of another.
   - Promotes code reusability.

4. **Polymorphism**
   - Ability to use a single interface for different data types or implementations.
   - Example: Method overloading and overriding.
